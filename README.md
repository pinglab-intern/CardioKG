### Title: Developing Graph Neural Network (GNN) model over Knowledgegraph in the interface of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) and Oxidative Stress (OS).

### Description: 
This project includes the development of Graph neural Network model with Knowledgegraph in the interface of the Cardiovascular Diseases and Oxidative Stress.

### Project Walkthrough:
1. Understand the schema, data content and development of the knowledgegraph in the interface of Cardiovascular Disease and Oxidative Stress from previous project.
2. Learn more about graph embedding functionality in Neo4j GDS library and DGL-KE library
3. Learn more about the fundamentals of machine learning models ( e.g., allocating data for training,validation and test, selecting proper GNN massage passing algorithm, selecting optimizer, Cost function, accuracy metric and inferences)
4. Explore about homogeneous Graph Neural Network with provided tutorial-1
5. Explore about heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with provided tutorail-2
6. Develope the graph embedding for OS-CVD intergace heterogeneous knowledge graph.
7. Prepare the training, valicdation and testing by masking the nodes or edges.
8. Train the model with tuning hyperparameters and interpret the performance.
9. Implement the model for link prediction and analyse it with biomedical findings.

### Educational Goal: 
This project offers the wonderful opportunity to learn and build cutting edge machine learning moldes in graph data. Participants will get hands on experience with GNN and KG libraries (e.g.,  Neo4j, DGL and Pytorch Geometric). 

### Scientific Goal:
Understaning the role of OS in Cardiovascualr Disease through molecular mechanism associated ionchannel proteins are the core of the scientific goal of the project. Prediction of the possible links between OS and CVD terms based on KG built through textmining of millions of documents opens the new horizon of the research. Newly predicted links could provid further insignt on understanding the molecular mechanism and disease pathogenesys.
